### Feature Tasks

1. Create web site in Django with 2 pages: home page and about page

2. Create views/urls/templates as needed for home and about pages

3. ~~Use ancestor template to contain navigation elements~~ (not demo'd in class and I couldn't make the stuff I found on Google work.Plain old html template used for nav vs ancestor template)

4. Should be built the “Django way” aka match the structure of in-class demo
